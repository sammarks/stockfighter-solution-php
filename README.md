# StockFighter PHP Solutions

**SPOILER ALERT** These are my **solutions** for StockFighter. Feel free to take a look at them and offer
critique/suggestions/advice/whatever, but just be aware that **if you do not want to see spoilers for
StockFighter, do not look at this code.**

I wrote a nifty PHP library that I use in this code, and that can be found (with no spoilers!)
